Circuit connections:
1) Blue LED [System OK LED] longer leg to one end of 330R resistor. 
2) The other end of the resistor goes to digital pin 3 of Arduino Uno.
3) Red LED [Alarm LED] longer leg to one end of 330R resistor. 
4) The other end of the resistor goes to digital pin 5 of Arduino Uno.
5) 1st pin of potentiometer goes to ground, 2nd (middle) pin goes to Analog pin A0, 3rd pin goes to 5V.
6) Connect one end of pushbutton to digital pin 2. 
7) Connect the same end to one end of the 10k resisor. 
8) Connect the other end of the 10k resistor to ground.
