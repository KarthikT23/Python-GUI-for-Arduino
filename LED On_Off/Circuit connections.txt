Circuit connections:
1) LED longer leg to one end of 330R resistor. 
2) The other end of the resistor goes to digital pin 3 of Arduino Uno.
3) Connect one end of pushbutton to digital pin 2. 
4) Connect the same end to one end of the 10k resisor. 
5) Connect the other end of the 10k resistor to ground.
